    <h1 class="text-center"> IP Addresses, Packets and Routing </h1><br>
    An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.
    IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.
    In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network:
    they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication.
    The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites.
    IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.
    <p class="text-justify">IP Routing describes the process of determining the path for data to follow in order to navigate from one computer or server to another.
        A packet of data traverses from its source router through a web of routers across many networks until it finally reaches its destination router using a routing algorithm.
        The routing algorithm takes into account factors such as the size of a packet and its header to determine the most efficient route to the destination.
        When a packet has reached a router, the source and destination address of the packet are used in conjunction with a routing table (list that contains the routes to a certain network) to determine the next hop address.
        This process is repeated for the next router using its own routing table until the packet has reached its destination.
        Because the data is divided into packets, each packet travels independently from each other and is treated as such.
        As a result, each packet can be sent through a different route to the destination if necessary.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">IP Routing is an umbrella term for the set of protocols that determine the path that data follows in order to travel across multiple networks from its source to its destination.
        Data is routed from its source to its destination through a series of routers, and across multiple networks.
        The IP Routing protocols enable routers to build up a forwarding table that correlates final destinations with next hop addresses.</p>
